# Tic-Tac-Toe-project
Simple Tic Tac Toe project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

This is my first project using JavaScript.

It's a classic Tic Tac Toe game.

This game has the following options:

Two modes: Single player (against computer) and two player mode.
1. UI with X and O symbols
2. Reset button to start a new game
3. Display the winner or a draw message at the end of the game
4. I hope that the code is well-documented and readable and that the game is responsive and accessible for desktop and mobile devices (on my devices it is responsive)

By following the link https://arya-su.github.io/ you can see how the game works.

My experience making the game: I always want the project to be as good as possible, and when making any project, a part of me never wants to stop until everything is perfect. There is room to improve so many things here, but due to time constraints I didn't want to destroy the functional code.

I won't say that I hope, but I know that I will continue to work on this project until it is the best it can be
